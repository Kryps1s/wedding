  <h2>About Lupiac</h2>
  <p>
    Lupiac is a pretty medieval village originally founded in 1090. It’s most famous for being the birthplace and childhood home of Charles de Batz Castelmore (otherwise known as D’Artagnan) who was born in Lupiac in 1613 and was the inspiration behind his namesake’s character in Alexandre Dumas’ “The Three Musketeers”. You can find a statue commemorating D’Artagnan in Lupiac itself, or drive 40 minutes to Condom to see the iconic statue of D’Artagnan with the other three musketeers.
